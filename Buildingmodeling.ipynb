    "## Introduction \n",
    "The aim of this project is to model the heat exchange of 2 rooms inside a building, to understand the thermal behavior of it. Nowadays, energy efficiency is a key pillar of the net-zero race, and building thermal modeling is a subject which has gained relevance. The limitations of this discipline is strongly correlated to the decarbonization targets set by governments. The building sector represents around 44% of the final energy consumption in France, meaning there is a huge potential for energy savings if thermal improvements are put in place. An in-depth understanding of a thermal model of a building is relevant to improve its overall efficiency. "

    "### Hyphotesis\n",
    "The report examines the thermal model-based building energy calculations. The following presumptions are included: \n",
    "- This model excludes the floor and ceiling heat transfer\n",
    "- Inner building surroundings to the rooms are considered neglectable, having only heat transfer from the outside and in between room 1 and 2\n",
    "- All forms of heat transmission are addressed linearly, even radiative exchange\n",
    "- Heat transport is unidirectional since the length and height of a wall is much bigger than the width \n",
    "- It is assumed that the temperature is distributed equally throughout each surface\n",
    "- No conduction is assumed in doors and windows\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the 2 rooms \n",
    "For this case study, we modeled 2 rooms, 42 and 36 $m^2$, respectively, separated by an internal door. Both rooms will have a window to the exterior, room 1 a door connecting to the outside, and room 2 will have mechanical ventilation. The diagram is exposed in Figure 1. \n",

    "#### Material and building components\n",
    "According to the assumptions made before, heat transfer is only due to vertical walls, that is the exterior walls and interior wall separating the 2 rooms. 2 materials for the walls were taken, concrete and insulation layers. The only difference between exterior and interior walls is the thickness of the layers as described below: \n",
